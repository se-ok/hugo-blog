# Introduction
One of my main responsibilities at work is to evaluate the large language models we train. The evaluation shall be easy to run, change, augment and also reproduce. One of the most popular such frameworks have been [lm-evaluation-harness](https://github.com/EleutherAI/lm-evaluation-harness), or in short, **harness**. However, starting from February, we have moved on from harness and been using one of our own evaluation code. This post is to describe rationale in the hope of letting people in similar situation consider building their own solutions.
