# Markdown Syntax Showcase

Welcome to this **Markdown Syntax Showcase**! This document demonstrates how various Markdown elements render on your page.

---

## 1. Headings

Headings help structure your document:

# Level 1 Heading
## Level 2 Heading
### Level 3 Heading
#### Level 4 Heading

---

## 2. Horizontal Rule

A horizontal rule separates sections:

---

## 3. Blockquotes

Blockquotes are great for highlighting quotes or notes:

> "The only limit to our realization of tomorrow is our doubts of today."  
> — Franklin D. Roosevelt

---

## 4. Code

### Inline Code

Display inline code like this: `console.log("Hello, Markdown!")`

### Code Block

Here's a code block in JavaScript:

```javascript
function greet(name) {
  console.log("Hello, " + name + "!");
}
greet("Markdown");
```

---

## 5. Tables

Tables help display structured data:

| Syntax    | Description                |
| --------- | -------------------------- |
| Header    | Title                      |
| Paragraph | Text content               |

---

## 6. Image Links

Display images with an alt text. For example, here’s the Hugo Book Theme logo:

![Hugo Book Theme](https://gohugo.io/images/hugo-logo-wide.svg)

---

## 7. Hyperlinks

Add clickable links like this: [Visit Hugo Themes](https://themes.gohugo.io/)

---

## 8. Colored Text

Markdown doesn't support colored text natively, but you can mix HTML for extra styling:

This is <span style="color: red;">red text</span> and this is <span style="color: blue;">blue text</span>.

---

## 9. Lists

### Unordered List

- Item 1
- Item 2
  - Subitem 2a
  - Subitem 2b

### Ordered List

1. First item
2. Second item
3. Third item

### Task List

- [x] Completed Task
- [ ] Pending Task

---

## 10. Nested Elements

Combine blockquotes with lists:

> **Note:** Here is a nested list:
> - Nested Item A
> - Nested Item B

---

## Conclusion

Markdown is versatile and lets you mix plain text with HTML to achieve enhanced formatting. Experiment with these elements to see what works best for your content!
